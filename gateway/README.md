# Agentic Control Tower Gateway

Self-hosted gateway for Agentic Control Tower.

This service is intentionally self-hosted and local-first:

- FastAPI gateway skeleton
- SQLite local persistence
- Device pairing with expiring pairing tokens
- Device public-key registration model
- WebSocket event stream with persisted cursor backfill
- `mobile_notify` endpoint with durable notification and audit records
- Fail-closed clearance decision skeleton
- RuntimeAdapter seam with Hermes as adapter #1
- Development-only TUI PTY prototype, disabled by default

Run locally:

```bash
uv run --project gateway uvicorn hermes_gateway.app:create_app --factory --reload
```

Run tests:

```bash
uv run --project gateway pytest
uv run --project gateway ruff check
```

The default bind should remain local or private-network only. Do not expose this
gateway on the public internet.

Hermes-local adapter calls should use loopback by default:

```python
from hermes_gateway.hermes_adapter import HermesToolAdapter

adapter = HermesToolAdapter(gateway_base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1")
```

If Hermes and the tower gateway are intentionally split across private infrastructure,
set `HERMES_ALLOWED_HERMES_CALLERS` or `HERMES_GATEWAY_ALLOWED_HERMES_CALLERS`
to exact allowed caller addresses.

Run the E2E smoke path:

```bash
uv run --project gateway python gateway/scripts/e2e_smoke.py
```

Enable the local TUI PTY prototype only in a disposable development context:

```bash
HERMES_TUI_ENABLE_LOCAL_PTY=1 \
HERMES_TUI_ALLOWED_COMMANDS=/bin/cat,/bin/sh \
HERMES_TUI_DEFAULT_COMMAND=/bin/cat \
uv run --project gateway uvicorn hermes_gateway.app:create_app --factory
```

The PTY runner requires signed paired-device REST controls and rejects
non-allowlisted commands or working directories outside the configured root.
